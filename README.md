What is it the citizens do to get the Bus as a primary mode of commute for bengaluru with reduced price/head - excellent service with access, safety, convenience.


**Open Sourcing Public Transport System, Organization, Architecture Design in India.**

**Introduction**

Namma Buss is a collaborative forum for the bengaluru bus community around an open source project. Discussions enable fluid, open conversation in a public forum. Discussions give a space for more collaborative conversations by connecting and giving a more centralized area to connect and find information.

Continuing the thought process - I want to share some of the interventions that I tried to get the bus system and see the huge potential of bus being a great transforming agent for mobility in Bengaluru . And people/commons have ignored merely out of apathy from both the state agencies and the people. Researchers have given a tag under the title "tragedy of commons" and left the system to perish. So all the key stakeholders have failed to arrive at a best way to optimize public transport system - leading to the proliferaation of other mobility businesses - like too many cars, too many taxis, bikes , bicycle sharing etc . But the crux of the problem is that no one gave it the attention it deserves. And most of the transport ministers have not focussed the attention on BMTC as it does not feth revenue for transport department.

**Ontology of the public transport system**: The first thing is we need a city bus running like namma metro - not under transport dept of karnataka state - but a city bus system operating under mayor of bengaluru.

**Problem 1: BMTC is monopoly of the state** - organization is based on nehruvian model of couple of soviet style bureaucrats running the system . Economy is capital /market driven. People segmented into various Identities/ Jobs - on religious , caste lines - where bus is not on the priority list. Avoiding bus is the priority - because it never comes on time or you can commit on time by depending on bus. Trust factor is less

**Approaching the problem:**
What we need to develop/create !

**Service stack**

1> We need to do a Service Design for the public transport systems - whether run by public / private.

We call it service stack - how we deliver and measure the public transport systems.



2> **Culture stack**

We need a internal culture that prioritizes innovation and agility and leadership to own the bus mobility system - this will not happen in the current mgmt setup and leadership style. A bureacrats stays as head of BMTC for 2-3 years - he comes with no background for transport - one of the IT heads of BMTC is from IFS - where is the link between forest service and IT systems - in a city that is overflowing with computer engineers and software techies - we have ignored how our city should be run. This is the root of all problems - forgetting our own abode and building others abode. We call it culture stack - leadership and company. Need to move away from communist style of governance.

 2a. **Leadership stack**
 2b. **Governance stack**
 2c. **Employee engagement/empowerment stack**

3> **Tech stack**

We need tech systems - to monitor and decide routes - to monitor behavior of people - to address safety for women - to enable easy access and convenience to travel in the bus. We call it namma bussu - bus tech stack. 4> **Fin Stack 

4> **Funding stack**

We need funding stack Who funds BMTC and What will be the stake of drivers and conductors ? Budget /Capital/Operations/Pricing/ This we call it the fund stack. 

5>**Community Stack** 

  We need the community stack - currently we have only one group interested to get buses in good shape.

**6> Stakeholder Stack**
We need a stakeholder stack - stakeholders appointed by citizens to manage bus systems. IN private set up the stake holders are share holders - in the public company no body owns a stake - so the loss is public - everyone loses. We do not have a good way to appoint stake holders for PSUs - that is why the PSUs have failed us - and people say we need to privatize and privatization is not the only way.

To get the above stacks in full swing we need a Architecture stack - where the ontology of the various stack components are listed and everyone decides to do their best to get the bus systems working - **Principle & Philosophy Stack **Architecture & Design Stack **Ops Stack => Finance, Governance **Deployment Stack = > Culture, Leadership, Service Design Stack Principles need to be defined . First principles and then Architecture.

**Base Architecture Stack**

In india we defined Architecture First and then principles - hence state failed to deliver quality systems and this has been the complaint of everyone including the bureaucrats and politicians. We need to say what are our principles - decentralization, priority, target group - whom will we serve at a subsidized price - students given discount, all the principles should be defined.

Next we define the culture and get the drivers and conductors to embrace a culture that gives them freedom to build from within - local talent is deployed with support from outside.

With these thoughts i am creating focus groups for rejuvenating BMTC into Namma Bussu.
